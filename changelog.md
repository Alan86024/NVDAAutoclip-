# NVDAAutoclip changelog

## V1.2.2

This version is mostly 1.2.1, but I forgot and called v1.2.1 v1.2.0, therefore this is a rerelease called v1.2.2 to clear up any possible confusion.

## V1.2.1

- Turkish translation by @babaprogramlar.

- Finnish translation by @jkinnunen.

- Updated the Vietnamese translation by nguyenninhhoang.

## V1.2.0

- NVDA 2024.1 support.

- fixed double speaking of the same text.

- added unassigned gesture to toggle interrupting speech before speaking the clipboard.

- You can now hide the option in the tools menu to toggle Autoclip. It can be found in the settings.

- When a large block of text is copied to the clipboard, it will be split into chunks of 300 character chunks and be spoken separately to avoid causing issues with speech synthesizers.

- Improved performance.
